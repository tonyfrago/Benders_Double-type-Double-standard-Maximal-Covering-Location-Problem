3. Also, these files are uploaded as part of the PhD thesis of Dr. Antonios Fragkogios (Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Thessaly, Greece) with the title "Acceleration of Benders Decomposition Method for the solution of Mixed Integer Linear Programming Problems".
4. The codes are written in C++ and they use CPLEX Optimization Software for the solution of the  Double-type Double-standard Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP).
